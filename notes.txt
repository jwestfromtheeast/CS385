What is an algorithm?
A sequence of unambiguous instructions for solving a rpbolem, i.e., for obtaining a required output for any
legitamate input in a finite amount of time.
Important points:
1. The nonambiguity requirement for each step of an algorithm cannot be compromised.
2. The range of inputs for which an algorithm works has to be specified carefully.
3. The same algorithm can be represented in several different ways.
4. There may exist several algorithms for solving the same problem.
